# Final Project - Web Game Development

### Project Description
This game is to be an Asteroids-style 2D web game built with JavaScript. I will be employing some of the
basic Asteroids mechanics, such as a movable / rotatable main character set in a 2D plane with no gravity, and some sort of asteroid-like obstacle. The
character / avatar / spaceship will emit or fire some sort of projectile to help combat the obstacles, in addition to free movement. I will build
on these mechanics and add new features of my own idea to help personalize the creation.
